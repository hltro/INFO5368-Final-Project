# Predicting Crime Occurrence in NYC Using Classification

This repository contains the final project for the Practical Applications in Machine Learning course at Cornell Tech. The project focuses on predicting crime occurrence in New York City using classification techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict whether a crime will occur based on various input features such as victim characteristics and location. The project aims to provide insights into crime patterns and contribute to crime prevention efforts.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following components:
* Build an end-to-end classification pipeline using various algorithms, such as logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
* Evaluate the performance of classification models using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Develop a web application that guides users through the steps of the classification pipeline and provides tools to analyze and compare different models across multiple metrics.
* Create a user-friendly interface where users can input the potential victim and location features and get predictions on the likelihood of crime occurrence.

The web application allows users to explore the performance of different classification models, visualize data, and understand the impact of different features on the prediction. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide insights into crime occurrence and assist in decision-making for crime prevention strategies.

## Dependencies
